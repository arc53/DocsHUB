## Todo list
- Github workflows to prepare json document with indexes ‚úÖ
- Website with search and index
- Plugin with DocsGPT
- Plugins for other projects
- API for search




## [Join Our parent projecs DocsGPT Discord](https://discord.gg/n5BX8dh8rU)


## Project structure
vectors - where all vecor stores are

ingestors - scripts to prepare and ingest data into vector stores


## How to use it:
Just navigate to a folder you need ```vectors/<language>/<library_name>/<version>/```
And download:
docs.index, faiss_store.pkl

## How to contribute:
Anyone can create a pull request. It should contain 3 files
1. docs.index
2. faiss_store.pkl
3. metadata.json


Ensure the path is correct 
```
  vectors/<language>/<library_name>/<version>/
```

if its python for example use
```
vectors/python/.project/version/
```
And in a corresponding path

Metadata is a json document with this fields:
- name
- language
- version
- description (one or two sectences)
- fullName (Full project name not a slug name)
- date (to know when it was last updated)
- docLink (link to the documentation that was used for it)

Example of metadata.json
```
{
  "name": "pandas",
  "language": "python",
  "version": "1.5.3",
  "description": "Pandas is alibrary providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.",
  "fullName": "Pandas",
  "date": "07/02/2023",
  "docLink": "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/"
}
```
